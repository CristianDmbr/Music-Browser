            Da Vinci (Da Vinci, Da Vinci)
            Yeah
            Shoutout the whole Oakland City, man
            
            You know what I'm sayin'? The whole 4PF
            You know what I'm sayin'? I put this up
            Shoutout my label, that's me
            
            I'm here with TB
            I'm here with 4 Trey
            I just poured up me a drink
            Real folks all in my face
            
            Five hundred racks in my safe
            Five hundred racks to the plug
            What you know 'bout showing love?
            
            What you know 'bout pulling up, in fancy trucks?
            Make these folks fall in love
            All of my friends on go
            None of my friends no joke
            
            All of my friends want action
            All of my friends together
            We came from the bottom
